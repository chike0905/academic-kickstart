abstract = "There are several studies that propose identity management that utilizes blockchain technology. In Ethereum, the main programmable blockchain system, data on a blockchain are saved as encoded binaries for executing automatic verification. To decode a binary, users need to know the application binary interfaces (ABI) that describes the data structure of the registered information. However, the manner by which ABI are shared in the current blockchain protocol is opaque. To resolve this problem, we describe a new protocol for embedding the ABI on a blockchain transaction when a registrant registers information. Our method enables users to read registered data with information on the blockchain alone, and it guarantees transparency without requiring users to trust third parties."
